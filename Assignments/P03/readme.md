## P03 - Processing in Trie Tree Time
### Tairique Davis

### Description:
The purpose of this program is to demonstrate an auto complete word search. This is achieved by reading a character input and comparing it with words stored in a
file. The words from the file are stored in a trie tree as a result searches are performed near instantly specfically in O(k) time.

### Instructions:
  - Download all files and add to IDE of your choosing. Code should work fine, there are no additional libraries required. 
  - OPTIONAL: Play around with program in P02 folder and look at the difference in search times when entering words
