## A03 - Commenting Code
### Tairique Davis
### Description

This software includes a class that generates a circular array-based queue. There is an array that 
 stores numbers, and as integers are added to the queue, they are added to the rear of the queue.
 Items may only be removed from the front of the queue. This program wasÂ  designed to demonstrate correct structure and commenting of future programs written in this CMPS 3013 repository.

### Instructions

- Download main.cpp and run code in IDE of your choosing. 
- Play around with the values passed main and observe how the queue changes
- No additional libraries are required

### Example Command

  - CircularArrayQue C1(5);
  -  C1.Push(1);     // pushing items onto queue
  -  cout << C1 << endl; // display queue
  -  C1.Pop();    // remove item from queue
  - cout << C1 << endl; //display updated queue
