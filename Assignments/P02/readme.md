### Program 2 - Auto Complete in Linear Time
### Class : 3013 - Advanced Algorithms

### Description:
The purpose of this program is to mimick an auto complete word search. 
This is achieved by reading a character input and comparing it with words stored in a file. The words from the file are stored in a singly linked list
as a result searches are performed linearly.

### Necessary Files 
  |   #   | File                                 | Description                       |
| :---: | ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------- |
|   1   | [main .cpp](main.cpp)                 | Main driver of program            |
|   2   | [List.hpp](List.hpp)                 | Linked-List implementation      |
|   3   | [mygetch.hpp](mygetch.hpp)           | getch header file              |
|   4   | [termcolor.hpp](termcolor.hpp)       | change color of text in terminal |
|   5   | [timer.hpp](timer.hpp)               | timer header file              |
|   6   | [dictionary.txt](dictionary.txt)     | words...lots of words           |


### Instructions:
  - Download all files and add to IDE of your choosing. Code should work fine, there are no additional libraries required. 
  - Allow sufficient time for searches to complete as the data strcuture used in this program is a linked list results can take several seconds
