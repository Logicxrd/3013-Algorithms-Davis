## P02 - Auto Complete in Linear Time
### Tairique Davis

### Description:
The purpose of this program is to mimick an auto complete word search. 
This is achieved by reading a character input and comparing it with words stored in a file. The words from the file are stored in a singly linked list
as a result searches are performed linearly.

### Instructions:
  - Download all files and add to IDE of your choosing. Code should work fine, there are no additional libraries required. 
  - Allow sufficient time for searches to complete as the data strcuture used in this program is a linked list results can take several seconds
